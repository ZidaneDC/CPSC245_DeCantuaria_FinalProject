 e. Final Project - Dialogue System
 f. This is my own work, and I did not cheat on this assignment.
  
2. All c# files used to create the dialogue system for this
   project are under Assets -> Scripts -> CPSC245_DialogueSystem.
   Files:
   TypewriterEffect.cs
   NPC.cs
   DialogueManager.cs
   Conversation.cs
   BranchingConversation.cs

3. No known runtime or compile errors as the project is currently,
   however errors will occur if the conversation arrays are incorrect.
   The sound is the only issue, though it does play when dialogue happens,
   the soundeffect I'm using is supposed to play for every letter in 
   the dialogue printed to the screen. Another thing to note is that
   in order to talk to an NPC again after their conversation ends, you
   need leave their range and reenter it to interact with them again.
